### Please read before contributing

1) Do not post questions in the issues tracker. If you have any questions about Social Stream, search the [Wiki](https://github.com/ging/social_stream/wiki) or use the [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/social-stream) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/social-stream). 

2) If you find a security bug, **DO NOT** submit an issue here. Please send an e-mail to [social-stream@dit.upm.es](mailto:social-stream@dit.upm.es) instead.

3) Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to see if it was already reported / fixed.

4) When reporting an issue, include Rails and Social Stream versions. If you are getting exceptions, please include the full backtrace.

That's it! The more information you give, the easier it becomes for us to track it down and fix it.
Ideally, you should provide an application that reproduces the error or a test case to Social Stream's suite.

Thanks!
